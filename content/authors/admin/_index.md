I'm a Florence Nightingale Bicentennial Fellow at the Department of Statistics, University of Oxford (faculty fellowship).
Prior to that I was a graduate student on the [StatML CDT](https://statml.io/) programme at the University of Oxford, working with [Tom Rainforth](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~twgr) and [Yee Whye Teh](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh).
<!-- During my PhD I did two research internships: one at Microsoft Reseach Cambridge, where I focused on causal machine learning and one at Meta AI (FAIR Labs) NYC, where I worked on neural data compression.
I am expected to complete my PhD in early 2025. -->
<!-- In April 2024 I will be starting as a Florence Nightingale Bicentenary Fellow at the department of Statistics, University of Oxford. -->
During my PhD I've interned as a Research Scientist at Microsoft Reseach Cambridge, where I focused on causal machine learning, and at Meta AI (FAIR Labs) NYC, where I worked on neural data compression.
Before StatML, I spent four years in quant finance -- first in quantitative equity research at UBS and later in cross-asset systematic trading strategies structuring at Goldman Sachs.

<!-- I'm passionate about the **rigorous** use of statistics and machine learning in **applied settings**, specifically when obtaining more data is difficult and/or impossible. In such cases I firmly believe it is crucial to 1) incorporate domain knowledge when training data-driven models; 2) thoroughly evaluate these models against suitable baselines; and 3) properly interpret the results of statistical analyses. -->

I'm broadly interested in probabilistic machine learning, with a focus on robustness and uncertainty quantification.
Currently, I'm thinking a lot about rigorous evaluation of LLMs and "foundation models" more generally.
For more about my work, see my [talks](event), [publications](publication) or my blog---[Probably Approximately Incorrect](https://probapproxincorrect.substack.com).

**Mentorship:** Many women in machine learning (and technical fields in general) face unique challenges, and the scarcity of female mentors and role models makes it worse. Whether you're transitioning from industry, considering graduate studies, or navigating an academic career in ML, connecting with someone who has walked a similar path can be super valuable. If you are a woman and are interested in scheduling an informal mentoring chat (online) [please get in touch via this form](https://forms.gle/LHFRe7u7fYdwftzC7).
