I'm interested in machine learning and statistics more broadly, particularly Bayesian. Currently, I'm on the [StatML](https://statml.io/) programme at the University of Oxford, working with [Tom Rainforth](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~twgr) and [Yee Whye Teh](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh).

Before joining the StatML CDT, I spent four years working in finance -- first in quantitative equity research at UBS and later in cross-asset systematic trading strategies structuring at Goldman Sachs.

I'm passionate about the proper use of statistics (and machine learning) both during the data modelling stage, and, crucially, when evaluating and interpreting the results of such statistical analyses.
