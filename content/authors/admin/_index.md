I'm interested in machine learning and statistics more broadly, particularly Bayesian.
Currently, I'm on the [StatML CDT](https://statml.io/) programme at the University of Oxford, working with [Tom Rainforth](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~twgr) and [Yee Whye Teh](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh).
During my PhD I did two research internships: one at Microsoft Reseach Cambridge, where I focused on causal machine learning and one at Meta AI (FAIR Labs) NYC, where I worked on neural data compression.
I am expected to complete my PhD in early 2025.
<!-- In April 2024 I will be starting as a Florence Nightingale Bicentenary Fellow at the department of Statistics, University of Oxford. -->

Before joining the StatML CDT in late 2020, I spent four years in quant finance -- first in quantitative equity research at UBS and later in cross-asset systematic trading strategies structuring at Goldman Sachs.

<!-- I'm passionate about the **rigorous** use of statistics and machine learning in **applied settings**, specifically when obtaining more data is difficult and/or impossible. In such cases I firmly believe it is crucial to 1) incorporate domain knowledge when training data-driven models; 2) thoroughly evaluate these models against suitable baselines; and 3) properly interpret the results of statistical analyses. -->

For more about my work, see my [talks](event) and [publications](publication).
