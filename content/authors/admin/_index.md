I'm interested in machine learning and statistics more broadly (particularly Bayesian). I'm a first year [StatML](https://statml.io/) student at the University of Oxford, working with [Tom Rainforth](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~twgr) and [Yee Whye Teh](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh).

Before joining the StatML programme, I spent four years working as a quant researcher in the City of London. I worked in quantitative equity research and later in cross-asset systematic trading strategies structuring.

I'm passionate about the proper use of statistics.
