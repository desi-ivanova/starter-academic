summary: "Whilst Bayesian deep learning (BDL) promises to address reliability and uncertainty in AI by combining Bayesian methods with deep learning, fundamental challenges and misconceptions have limited its practical impact, calling for a critical reassessment of BDL's role and potential compared to non-Bayesian alternatives in real-world applications."

abstract: "What exactly is the role of Bayes in this modern day and age of AI where many of the original promises of Bayes are being (or at least seem to be) unlocked simply by scaling? Non-Bayesian approaches appear to solve many problems that Bayesians once dreamt of solving using Bayesian methods. We thus believe that it is timely and important to rethink and redefine the promises and challenges of Bayesian approaches; and also to elucidate which Bayesian methods might prevail against their non-Bayesian competitors; and finally identify key application areas where Bayes can shine."
